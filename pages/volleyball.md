Hello,

I started playing volleyball when I was around 14 years old at a competitive level.  I first started playing at a club called Surf City for my 14's year and then Seacliff for my (1st) 16's year.  I then moved to Balboa Bay volleyball club and played 16's, 17's, and 18's there. I also went to Mater Dei for high school and was a 4 year varcity starter.  My sophmore year at Mater Dei I was fortunate enough to win the CIF Souther Section Championship.  

Fast forward a couple months and my Balboa Bay club team is competing at the Junior Olympics where we ended up winning Gold and I was awarded MVP.  Rich Polk coached the 16's club team and still does to this day.  Whenever I reflect on all of my coaches that I had in my life, Rich was the one that I felt that really changed me for the better.  

I never won another title at Mater Dei but did receive some personal accolades like All-League and All-CIF team multiple times.  During my 17's year at Balboa Bay we won Silver and the Junior Olympics and I was apart of the All-Tournament Team.  During my 18's final club season, we won again won the Silver Medal at JO's. I was fortunate enough to get a scholarship to play for the University of California, Irvine.  

My time there was incredible and I wouldn't change it for anything in the world.  I was faced with consistant adversity which only forged more powerful bonds with my teammates.  Every year was a journey to win a title and each very different.  Unfortunately, I was never lucky enough to win an NCAA Division 1 title as a player* but the culture of UCI has shaped me to who I am today.

**I'm currently coaching at Mater Dei and you never know...*
