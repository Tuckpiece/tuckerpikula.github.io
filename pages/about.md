Hello,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is Tucker Pikula and I am a recent graduate from the University of California, Irvine.  I was blessed with the opportunity to play Division 1 volleyball at one of the most prestigious public schools in the country.  Being a student-athlete has definitely changed who I am and how I perceive things.  I treat tasks given to me the same way I would compete for a championship - with relentless precision and perfection.
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I recently finished coaching Men's Varsity Volleyball at Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana.  I'm looking for a sales or marketing job as I need to get experience under my belt.  I love the NBA and sports in general and would love to work in this field at some point in my life.  Most importantly, I'm looking for a company that has a great culture where I can learn from the best.  I'm very open to moving if the job is of interest to me.
  
Thank you for checking out my page!
