Hello,

 	My name is Tucker Pikula and I am a recent graduate from the University of California, Irvine.  I was blessed with the opportunity to play Division 1 volleyball at one of the most prestigious public schools in the country.  Being a student-athlete has definitely changed who I am and how I perceive things.  I treat tasks given to me the same way I would compete for a championship - with relentless precision and perfection.
  
   I'm currently an assistant varsity volleyball coach for Mater Dei high school.  I'm hoping to line up a job or intership after the season ends around April (if the position starts before April, I'm sure we can figure something out).  I'm open to anything in the business field as I need to get experience under my belt and learn more about my likes and dislikes.  I'm a very hard working individual and all I need is a chance to prove myself.
  

Thank you for checking out my page!
